#+TITLE: Org-mode Links, Images, and Footnotes
#+AUTHOR: Demo Collection
#+DATE: 2024-01-15

This file demonstrates all types of links in Org-mode: external URLs, internal
links, file links, custom ID links, image links, and footnotes with various
formats.

* External URL Links

** Bracket Links with Descriptions

Standard web links use bracket notation for clean display:

- [[https://orgmode.org][Official Org-mode Website]]
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs Homepage]]
- [[https://github.com][GitHub - Code Hosting Platform]]
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/org-mode][Org-mode Questions on Stack Overflow]]

Documentation resources:
- [[https://orgmode.org/manual/][The Org Manual (Latest Version)]]
- [[https://orgmode.org/worg/][Worg: Community-Driven Documentation]]
- [[https://orgmode.org/guide/][Compact Org-mode Guide for Beginners]]

** Plain URL Links (Auto-Linked)

URLs without brackets are auto-linked when recognized:

Visit https://orgmode.org for complete documentation.

Common URLs:
- https://www.wikipedia.org
- https://news.ycombinator.com
- https://reddit.com/r/orgmode
- http://example.com (HTTP is also supported)
- https://api.github.com/repos/org-mode/org-mode

** Angle Bracket Links

Explicit linking using angle brackets:

<https://www.google.com>
<https://www.example.com>
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616>

** Email Links

Contact links using mailto:

- [[mailto:user@example.com][Send Email to User]]
- [[mailto:support@company.com?subject=Bug%20Report][Report a Bug]]
- Plain email: mailto:info@example.org
- Angle bracket: <mailto:contact@example.com>

* Internal Links (Within Document)

** Links to Headings

Link to headings by their exact title:

- [[*External URL Links][Jump to URL Links Section]]
- [[*File Links and Paths][See File Links Below]]
- [[*Footnote Demonstrations][Go to Footnotes Section]]
- [[*Image Links][View Image Examples]]

You can also link to nested headings:

- [[*Bracket Links with Descriptions][Links with Descriptions Subsection]]
- [[*Reference Style Footnotes][Reference Footnotes]]

** Links to Custom IDs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: custom-id-section
   :END:

This section has a custom ID defined in its properties drawer.

Links using custom IDs are more stable than heading-based links:

- [[#custom-id-section][Link to This Section via Custom ID]]
- [[#important-note][Link to Important Note Below]]
- [[#example-code][Link to Code Example]]

** Target Definitions and Links

You can define explicit targets in your document:

This paragraph contains a <<target-location>> that can be linked to.

Another paragraph with a <<named-target>> for demonstration.

Links to targets:
- [[target-location][Link to First Target]]
- [[named-target][Link to Named Target]]

** Radio Targets

A <<<radio target>>> is automatically linked wherever it appears.

Now when you mention "radio target" elsewhere in the document, it becomes
a link automatically (in some Org-mode implementations).

* File Links and Paths

** Links to Local Files

Basic file links:

- [[file:basics.org][Open Basics Demo File]]
- [[file:lists.org][Open Lists Demo File]]
- [[file:./tables.org][Table Examples (Relative Path)]]
- [[file:~/Documents/notes.org][Notes in Home Directory]]

** Links to Specific Lines or Headings in Files

- [[file:basics.org::*Text Formatting Showcase][Specific Section in Basics File]]
- [[file:lists.org::42][Line 42 in Lists File]]
- [[file:code-blocks.org::#example-code][Custom ID in Another File]]

** Links to Files with Search Options

- [[file:metadata.org::/DEADLINE/][Search for DEADLINE in Metadata File]]
- [[file:basics.org::TODO][First TODO in Basics File]]

** Directory Links

- [[file:/Users/mac/Desktop/strideshift2026/org_viewer/demo/][Demo Directory]]
- [[file:~/Desktop/][Desktop Folder]]
- [[file:./][Current Directory]]

* Image Links

** Basic Image Syntax

Images use the same link syntax but point to image files:

[[file:media/logo.png]]

** Images with Descriptions

[[file:media/screenshot.png][Application Screenshot]]

** Images with Attributes

You can specify image attributes using #+ATTR directives:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px :alt "Architecture Diagram"
[[file:media/architecture.png]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 300px :height 200px :class "centered-image"
[[file:media/chart.png][Performance Chart]]

** External Image URLs

[[https://orgmode.org/img/org-mode-unicorn-logo.png][Org-mode Logo]]

[[https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Example+Image][Placeholder Image Example]]

** Multiple Images in Sequence

Project screenshots:

[[file:media/home-screen.png][Home Screen]]

[[file:media/dashboard.png][Dashboard View]]

[[file:media/settings.png][Settings Panel]]

* Footnote Demonstrations

** Inline Text with Footnote References

Org-mode is a powerful plain-text markup language[fn:1] created for GNU Emacs.
It supports complex document structures[fn:2], task management, and literate
programming[fn:literate].

The syntax is designed to be human-readable[fn:3] while providing extensive
functionality for technical writing and project planning.

** Reference Style Footnotes

Academic writing often requires citations[fn:citation] and references to
external sources[fn:source]. Org-mode handles this elegantly with named
footnotes that can be defined anywhere in the document[fn:placement].

** Inline Footnotes

You can also define footnotes inline[fn:: This footnote is defined right where
it's referenced, without needing a separate definition section.] which is
convenient for short notes.

Another inline example[fn:: Inline footnotes can span multiple lines and
include formatting like *bold* and /italic/ text.] shows multi-line content.

Complex inline footnote[fn:: You can even include lists in inline footnotes:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three
Though this is rarely needed.] with a list.

** Multiple References to Same Footnote

The same footnote can be referenced multiple times[fn:repeated]. This is useful
when the same source[fn:repeated] needs to be cited in different locations.

** Named vs Numbered Footnotes

Named footnotes[fn:named-example] use descriptive labels, while numbered
ones[fn:4] use simple numbers. Both work identically.

** Footnotes with URLs and Links

External references often need URLs[fn:url-example] or links to other
documents[fn:doc-link].

** Important Note Section
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: important-note
   :END:

This section demonstrates custom IDs for stable linking. Custom IDs don't
change if you rename the heading, making them ideal for permanent links.

* Link Protocol Examples

** Special Protocols

Beyond HTTP/HTTPS, Org-mode supports various protocols:

- [[info:org#Hyperlinks][Info Page Links]]
- [[shell:ls -la][Shell Command Links (use with caution)]]
- [[elisp:(message "Hello from Emacs Lisp")][Elisp Code Links]]
- [[doi:10.1000/xyz123][DOI Academic Paper Link]]

** ID Links

Links using globally unique IDs:

- [[id:12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc][Link to Item by UUID]]

* Footnote Definitions

Below are the footnote definitions referenced throughout this document:

[fn:1] Org-mode was created by Carsten Dominik in 2003 and has since become
one of the most popular markup languages for technical writing and personal
knowledge management.

[fn:2] Complex structures include hierarchical headings, nested lists, tables,
source code blocks, mathematical equations, and embedded images.

[fn:literate] Literate programming, introduced by Donald Knuth, combines
source code with detailed explanations in natural language. Org-mode supports
this through its code block execution and tangling features.

[fn:3] Human readability means the raw Org-mode file is easy to read and edit
in any text editor, not requiring special software to understand the basic
structure and content.

[fn:citation] Smith, J. (2024). "Effective Technical Writing with Org-mode."
Journal of Documentation Systems, 15(3), 234-256.

[fn:source] Official Org-mode documentation: https://orgmode.org/manual/

[fn:placement] Footnote definitions can appear anywhere in the document, though
by convention they are often placed at the end of sections or at the document
end.

[fn:repeated] This footnote is referenced multiple times to demonstrate that
capability. The same definition serves all references.

[fn:named-example] Named footnotes use descriptive labels like "named-example"
instead of numbers, making them easier to manage in large documents.

[fn:4] Numbered footnotes are simpler but can become difficult to manage if you
insert new footnotes in the middle of a document.

[fn:url-example] For more information, see the official specification at
https://orgmode.org/manual/Creating-Footnotes.html

[fn:doc-link] Related documentation can be found in [[file:basics.org][the Basics
file]] and [[file:metadata.org][the Metadata file]].
