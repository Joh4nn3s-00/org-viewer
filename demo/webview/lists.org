different bullet styles, ordered lists with different numbering formats,
description lists, checkbox lists, and complex nested combinations.

* Unordered Lists with Different Bullets

** Using Dash (-) Bullets

- First item in the list
- Second item with more details
- Third item
  - Nested item under third
  - Another nested item
- Fourth item back at top level

** Using Plus (+) Bullets

+ Alternative bullet style with plus
+ Second item
+ Third item
  + Nested with plus
  + Another nested item
    + Even deeper nesting
+ Back to top level

** Using Asterisk (*) Bullets

Note: Single asterisk lists must have space after the asterisk to distinguish
from headings.

- First item (dash)
  * Nested with asterisk
  * Another asterisk item
    - Even deeper with dash
    - More deep items
  * Back to asterisk level
- Back to dash level

** Numeric Lists with Period (1. 2. 3.)

1. First ordered item
2. Second ordered item
3. Third ordered item
   1. Nested numbered item
   2. Another nested item
   3. Third nested item
4. Back to main sequence
5. Fifth item continues sequence

** Numeric Lists with Parenthesis (1) 2) 3))

* List Continuation and Breaking

Sometimes you need to continue a list after interrupting with other content:

1. First item in sequence
2. Second item

This is an interrupting paragraph that breaks the list. To continue the
numbering, you need to explicitly specify the number.

3. Third item continuing sequence
4. Fourth item

Alternative approach using [@N] syntax:

1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item

Another interruption here.

3. [@3] Explicitly numbered third item
4. [@4] Explicitly numbered fourth item

* Edge Cases and Special Scenarios

** Empty List Items

- First item
-
- Third item (second was empty)
- Fourth item

** List Items with Multiple Paragraphs

- This is the first list item.

  This is a second paragraph within the same list item. It maintains the
  indentation to stay part of the same item.

- This is the second list item.

  It also has a continuation paragraph.

  And even a third paragraph, all part of the same item.

- Third item is simple.

** Lists with Code Blocks

1. Install dependencies:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   npm install
   #+END_SRC

2. Run the application:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   npm start
   #+END_SRC

3. Verify it's working by visiting http://localhost:3000
