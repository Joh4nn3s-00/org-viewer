* Quote Blocks

** Simple Quote

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
— Alan Kay
#+END_QUOTE

** Multi-Paragraph Quote

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's
mind there are few. When we start learning something new, we approach it
with an open mind and fresh perspective.

As we gain expertise, we often become constrained by what we already know,
limiting our creativity and problem-solving ability. The challenge is to
maintain that beginner's mindset even as we gain experience.

— Shunryu Suzuki, "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind"
#+END_QUOTE

** Quote with Inline Formatting

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Programs must be written for people to read*, and only /incidentally/ for
machines to execute. The programming language is a tool for ~human thought~
and =communication= first, and a notation for instructing computers second.

— Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, "Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs"
#+END_QUOTE

** Nested Quote-Like Structure

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As Albert Einstein once noted:

"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own
reason for existing."

This principle applies especially well to software development, where
constant questioning of assumptions leads to better designs and more robust
solutions.
#+END_QUOTE

** Simple Poem

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

— Robert Frost, "The Road Not Taken"
#+END_VERSE

** Code-Like Verse

#+BEGIN_VERSE
function life() {
  while (breathing) {
    learn();
    grow();
    contribute();
  }
  return legacy;
}

— A Developer's Philosophy
#+END_VERSE

Code written today
Tomorrow's legacy, maybe
Or tomorrow's tech debt

— Anonymous Developer
#+END_VERSE

This is hidden and won't be exported.
It contains notes about the section above.
TODO: Expand this section with more examples.
#+END_COMMENT

More visible content continues here.

* Line Comments

# This is a line comment - it won't be rendered
# Line comments start with # at the beginning of a line
# They're useful for quick notes that shouldn't be exported

This paragraph is visible.

# TODO: Add more examples here
# NOTE: Remember to update the statistics

* LaTeX Formatting

** Inline Math

*** Simple Equations

Einstein's famous equation: $E = mc^2$

Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

Quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$

*** Math in Sentences

The area of a circle is $A = \pi r^2$ where $r$ is the radius. For a circle
with radius $r = 5$ units, the area is $A = 25\pi \approx 78.54$ square units.

The probability density function of a normal distribution is
$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$
where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

** Alternative Inline Math Syntax

Using \(parentheses\) for inline math: \(f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1\)

The derivative: \(\frac{df}{dx} = 2x + 2\)

Integration: \(\int_0^1 x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}\)

** Display Math (Double Dollar Signs)

Centered display equations use double dollar signs:

$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x} dx = 1$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

$$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0$$

** Display Math (Escaped Brackets)

Alternative display math syntax:

\[
\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}
\]

\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0
\]

** Complex Mathematical Expressions

*** Matrix Notation

The transformation matrix:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
ax + by \\
cx + dy
\end{pmatrix}
$$

*** Summation and Products

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{ij} = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{ij}
$$

$$
\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot x_n
$$

*** Calculus Expressions

The fundamental theorem of calculus:

$$
\int_a^b f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

where $F'(x) = f(x)$

Chain rule:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$

*** Systems of Equations

\[
\begin{cases}
x + y = 5 \\
2x - y = 1
\end{cases}
\]

Solution: $x = 2, y = 3$

$$

*** Linear Algebra

Vector notation: $\vec{v}, \vec{a}, \vec{b}$

Dot product: $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\cos\theta$

Cross product: $\vec{a} \times \vec{b}$

Matrix determinant:
$$
\det(A) = \begin{vmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{vmatrix} = ad - bc
$$

*** Statistics

Normal distribution: $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$

Probability: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A)$

Expected value: $E[X] = \sum_{i} x_i P(X = x_i)$

Variance: $\text{Var}(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$

Mathematical beauty in programming:

$$f(n) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } n = 0 \\
1 & \text{if } n = 1 \\
f(n-1) + f(n-2) & \text{if } n > 1
