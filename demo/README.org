#+TITLE: Org-mode Basics: Headings and Text Formatting
#+AUTHOR: Demo Collection
#+DATE: 2024-01-15

This file demonstrates the fundamental building blocks of Org-mode documents:
headings at all levels, TODO keywords, priorities, tags, and all inline
text formatting options.

* First Level Heading

This is regular paragraph text under a first-level heading. Paragraphs can
span multiple lines and will wrap naturally. You can include various inline
formatting within paragraphs as shown below.

** Second Level Heading

Second-level headings are great for major subsections. Here we demonstrate
*bold text*, /italic text/, and _underlined text_. You can also combine
them: */bold italic/*, _/*underlined bold italic*/_. \\
This line follows a line break.

*** Third Level Heading

Third-level headings dive deeper into topics. Use =verbatim text= for literal
values and ~code snippets~ for inline code. You can also use +strikethrough+
for deleted or deprecated content.

**** Fourth Level Heading

Mathematical notation uses superscripts like e^{2} or E = mc^{2}, and
subscripts like H_{2}O or x_{1}, x_{2}, ..., x_{n}.

***** Fifth Level Heading

Special entities provide symbols: \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \Delta, \rightarrow,
\Rightarrow, \infty, \sum, \int, \LaTeX, \TeX. These render as proper symbols.

****** Sixth Level Heading

This is the deepest standard heading level in Org-mode. It's useful for very
detailed hierarchical documents but use sparingly to avoid overwhelming depth.

* TODO Headings with Keywords

** TODO This task is not yet complete
   DEADLINE: <2024-01-20 Sat>

This heading has a TODO keyword, indicating it's an actionable item. The
deadline shows when it should be completed.

** DONE This task has been completed
   CLOSED: [2024-01-15 Mon 14:30]

Tasks marked DONE are complete. The CLOSED timestamp records when they were
finished.

** TODO This task is in progress
   SCHEDULED: <2024-01-16 Tue>

Scheduled timestamps indicate when you plan to start working on a task.

* Headings with Priority Cookies

** TODO [#A] High priority critical bug fix

Priority A items are urgent and important. They should be addressed first.

** TODO [#B] Medium priority feature request

Priority B items are important but not urgent. Handle after priority A items.

** TODO [#C] Low priority documentation update

Priority C items are nice to have. Work on these when higher priorities are done.

* Headings with Tags                                                    :demo:

** Project Planning                                               :work:planning:

Tags help categorize and filter headings. This heading has both work and
planning tags.

** Personal Development                                      :personal:learning:

You can use tags to quickly find related items across your Org files.

** Team Meeting Notes                                    :meeting:team:important:

Multiple tags create a flexible organization system. Tags are inherited by
child headings.

*** Action Items                                                   :actionable:

This inherits :meeting:team:important: from parent and adds :actionable:.

* Headings with Statistics Cookies

** Project Tasks [2/5]

Statistics cookies track progress. This format shows 2 out of 5 items complete.

*** TODO Design mockups
*** DONE Initial research
*** TODO Backend implementation
*** DONE Requirements gathering
*** TODO Testing and QA

** Sprint Goals [40%]

Percentage format shows 40% completion. Useful for progress tracking.

*** DONE Setup development environment
*** DONE Configure CI/CD pipeline
*** TODO Implement authentication
*** TODO Add user dashboard
*** TODO Deploy to staging

* Combined Features Demonstration

** TODO [#A] Q1 Release Planning [3/7]                    :project:milestone:
   SCHEDULED: <2024-01-18 Thu>
   DEADLINE: <2024-03-31 Sun>

This heading combines: TODO keyword, priority [#A], statistics cookie [3/7],
tags :project:milestone:, and both SCHEDULED and DEADLINE timestamps.

The body contains *bold statements*, /italic emphasis/, and ~code references~.
We need to achieve e^{growth} where growth > 1.5, focusing on H_{2}O treatment
efficiency \rightarrow increased capacity.

Key metrics include:
- \alpha (confidence level) = 0.95
- \beta (power) = 0.80
- Performance \Delta > 20%

*** DONE Phase 1: Requirements
*** DONE Phase 2: Design
*** DONE Phase 3: Prototype
*** TODO Phase 4: Implementation
*** TODO Phase 5: Testing
*** TODO Phase 6: Documentation
*** TODO Phase 7: Deployment

* Text Formatting Showcase

This paragraph demonstrates all inline formatting in context. We have *bold
assertions* and /italic emphasis/ for style. Use _underlines_ sparingly for
emphasis. Technical writing includes =literal values= like =config.yaml= and
~code snippets~ like ~function()~. Mark +deprecated features+ with
strikethrough.

Scientific notation: E = mc^{2}, velocity v = x/t, concentration C =
n_{solute}/V_{solution}. Chemical formulas: H_{2}SO_{4}, CO_{2}, C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}.

Mathematical symbols: \alpha + \beta = \gamma, A \cup B, x \in \mathbb{R},
f: X \rightarrow Y, \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}, \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x}dx = 1,
\LaTeX and \TeX for typesetting.

Special characters: \copyright, \registered, \trademark, \euro, \pound,
\degree, \pm, \times, \div, \leq, \geq, \neq, \approx, \equiv.

Combining formats: */bold italic/*, _/underlined italic/_, *_bold underlined_*,
=_literal underlined_=, ~*code bold*~ (though some combinations may not render
as expected depending on the parser).

Multiple spaces     are     preserved     in     some     contexts.
Line breaks force new lines\\
like this one\\
and this one.
