#+DESCRIPTION: Comprehensive demonstration of Org-mode metadata features
#+KEYWORDS: org-mode, metadata, properties, timestamps
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:t todo:t tags:t ':t H:4
#+STARTUP: overview
#+CATEGORY: Documentation
#+FILETAGS: :demo:metadata:reference:

This file demonstrates all metadata-related features in Org-mode: document
keywords, property drawers, custom drawers, planning information, timestamps
in various formats, clock entries, and node properties.

* Document-Level Keywords

The keywords at the top of this file (#+TITLE, #+AUTHOR, etc.) are document-level
metadata. They configure how the document is processed and exported.

Common keywords demonstrated above:
- TITLE: Document title
- AUTHOR: Author name
- DATE: Document date
- EMAIL: Contact email
- LANGUAGE: Document language code
- DESCRIPTION: Brief description for exports
- KEYWORDS: Search keywords
- OPTIONS: Export and display options
- STARTUP: Initial fold state when opening
- CATEGORY: Default category for agenda items
- FILETAGS: Tags applied to all headings

* Property Drawers

** Heading with Basic Properties
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CREATED:  [2024-01-15 Mon 10:00]
   :CUSTOM_ID: basic-properties
   :CATEGORY: Examples
   :EFFORT:   2:00
   :END:

This heading has a property drawer with several common properties. The
CUSTOM_ID allows stable linking, CATEGORY helps organize in agenda views,
and EFFORT estimates time required.

** Project Task with Extended Properties
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: project-task-example
   :ASSIGNED: Alice Johnson
   :PRIORITY: High
   :STARTED:  [2024-01-10 Wed]
   :DEADLINE_DATE: <2024-01-25 Thu>
   :ESTIMATED_HOURS: 16
   :ACTUAL_HOURS: 8
   :STATUS:   In Progress
   :CATEGORY: Development
   :PROJECT:  UserAuth
   :TAGS:     backend security
   :END:

Custom properties can store any key-value pairs relevant to your workflow.
This example shows project management properties.

** Document Reference with Metadata
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: document-reference
   :DOCUMENT_TYPE: Technical Specification
   :VERSION:  2.1.0
   :REVIEWED_BY: Bob Smith, Carol Davis
   :REVIEW_DATE: [2024-01-12 Fri]
   :STATUS:   Approved
   :LOCATION: [[file:~/docs/specs/auth-spec.org]]
   :RELATED:  [[#api-design]], [[#security-considerations]]
   :END:

Properties can include links to other documents or sections.

* Custom Drawers

** LOGBOOK Drawer for Activity Tracking
   :LOGBOOK:
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2024-01-15 Mon 14:30]
   - State "TODO"       from "IN-PROGRESS" [2024-01-15 Mon 09:15]
   - State "IN-PROGRESS" from "TODO"      [2024-01-14 Sun 16:45]
   - Note taken on [2024-01-14 Sun 16:50] \\
     Started implementation after design review approval
   - Note taken on [2024-01-13 Sat 11:20] \\
     Discussed approach with team lead, got green light to proceed
   :END:

The LOGBOOK drawer tracks state changes and notes. Org-mode can automatically
populate this when you change TODO states or add notes.

** Custom NOTES Drawer

*** Meeting Discussion Points
    :NOTES:
    Discussion points from team meeting on [2024-01-12 Fri]:

    - Reviewed current architecture limitations
    - Discussed three potential solutions:
      1. Microservices approach (team preferred)
      2. Modular monolith
      3. Event-driven architecture
    - Decided to prototype microservices approach
    - Timeline: 2 weeks for proof of concept

    Action items assigned in main heading.
    :END:

Custom drawers can organize related information. Use any name except reserved
ones like PROPERTIES, LOGBOOK, and CLOCK.

** REFERENCES Drawer
   :REFERENCES:
   - [[https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html][Microservices Guide by Martin Fowler]]
   - [[https://12factor.net/][The Twelve-Factor App Methodology]]
   - Internal doc: [[file:~/docs/architecture/service-design.org][Service Design Guidelines]]
   - Related ticket: [[https://jira.company.com/browse/PROJ-1234][PROJ-1234]]
   :END:

A REFERENCES drawer can collect all related links and citations.

* Planning Information and Timestamps

** TODO Task with Scheduled Date
   SCHEDULED: <2024-01-18 Thu>

This task is scheduled to start on January 18th. The SCHEDULED timestamp
indicates when you plan to work on it.

** TODO Task with Deadline
   DEADLINE: <2024-01-22 Mon>

This task must be completed by January 22nd. The DEADLINE timestamp indicates
when it's due.

** TODO Task with Both Scheduled and Deadline
   SCHEDULED: <2024-01-16 Tue> DEADLINE: <2024-01-20 Sat>

Tasks can have both scheduled start and deadline dates.

** DONE Completed Task with Closed Timestamp
   CLOSED: [2024-01-15 Mon 15:45]

Completed tasks can record when they were finished using a CLOSED timestamp.
This is automatically added when you mark a TODO as DONE (if configured).

** TODO Urgent Task with Warning Period
   DEADLINE: <2024-01-25 Thu -3d>

The -3d indicates a warning period. You'll be warned 3 days before the deadline.

** TODO Recurring Task Weekly
   SCHEDULED: <2024-01-17 Wed +1w>

The +1w makes this a repeating task that recurs every week. When marked DONE,
it automatically reschedules to the next week.

** TODO Recurring Task Monthly
   SCHEDULED: <2024-02-01 Thu +1m>

Monthly recurring task using +1m repeater.

** TODO Task with Delay After Completion
   SCHEDULED: <2024-01-20 Sat .+2w>

The .+2w means this task will be scheduled 2 weeks after completion, not from
the original scheduled date. Useful for tasks like "review backups".

   :PROPERTIES:
   :END:

This heading has an empty property drawer.

** Multiple Custom Drawers

*** Research Notes with Multiple Drawers
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: research-notes
    :CATEGORY: Research
    :END:
    :ABSTRACT:
    This section explores the implementation of distributed caching strategies
    for high-traffic web applications. Focus on Redis cluster configuration
    and cache invalidation patterns.
    :END:
    :METHODOLOGY:
    1. Literature review of existing solutions
    2. Performance benchmarking of different approaches
    3. Prototype implementation
    4. Load testing and optimization
    :END:
    :FINDINGS:
    - Redis Cluster provides better scalability than single instance
    - Cache-aside pattern works well for read-heavy workloads
    - Careful key design prevents hotspots
    - Monitor cache hit rates and adjust TTLs accordingly
    :END:
